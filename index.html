        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Sheila Isidoro, I am a second year education major. I am headed towards the path to become an Education Policy Maker whilst also obtaining my teaching credentials. I have a concentration in Social Justice focusing on K-12 education.I went towards the education path because of my upbringing. In being over 7+ school systems in different U.S. states, I experienced many different educational opportunities that have positively impacted me for the greater part and inspired me to head towards that path. However, since college I have taken courses in education policy greatly inspiring me to head towards the policy field in education to make an even greater impact as a policy maker. I have always had a desire to serve my community which can be achieved through great educational reform in our system starting as a teacher then going to become a policy maker. 

<br><br>

        Over the years, I have had experience working with children in various programs one being the Migrant Program. Which was designed for students of immigrant parents that are constantly moving places and require extra support to catch up to the material they are falling behind on. Such efforts of a program greatly moved me and inspired me as I too was a student for this program. Experience such as being a tutor for the Migrant Program allowed me to receive an internship for the Early Childhood Center at UCR. 

Being a child of immigrant parents, I received a different education experience in the U.S. which has greatly impacted and influenced the person I am today and my goals. I want my voice to serve as the voice of many other students such as myself that are experiencing the educational system. With the many issues made evident in our system, I aim to help make a difference and provide a voice to the many underrepresented students. 
<br><br>

        I have participated in many groups and organizations that have provided me with many opportunities of personal growth and networking connections. For example, since Iâ€™ve been in a sorority, I have made endless connections beyond my sisters that have opened many doors for me. Actively participating and speaking with professors has opened the opportunity for studying abroad overseas in India. Having such an opportunity would provide me with the experience of the education system in other countries and seeing how impacted students are varying on their conditions including many factors. Carrying this information following me onto my career, itâ€™ll provide me with greater insight and can help me reflect on my work not just as an Educator but as an Education Policy Maker. 

Growing up as a first-generation Latinx, I had my own experience with the U.S. education system that wasnâ€™t designed for students as myself with generations of deep rooted racism embedded which unfortunately is still seen in our curriculum today. As a future Educator and Policy Maker, I will aim at dismantling and reconstructing our system striving for equity being prominent in the education system we will see in the future thatâ€™ll change America for the better.
